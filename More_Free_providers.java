Sure, let's go through the features and limitations of the free plans for GitHub Pages and Glitch.

**GitHub Pages:**

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

Features of the free plan include:

- Website may be up to 1GB in size.
- Bandwidth: 100GB per month.
- You can set your own domain name for your website via CNAME.
- There is support for HTTPS for the website. 

Limitations:

- Since GitHub Pages is designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages from a GitHub repository, it doesn't support server-side code such as PHP, Ruby, or Python.
- It's not designed for high traffic volumes so if your site has a lot of traffic, you may want to consider other options.
- The customization options are quite limited compared to other hosting services.

**Glitch:**

Glitch is a simple tool for creating web apps. It's designed for creating and sharing your web development projects.

Features of the free plan include:

- Provides 4000 requests/hour.
- The server processes 512MB of RAM.
- Storage capacity 512MB.
- Unlimited static sites.
- Support for import/export GitHub function.

Limitations:

- Your code and project will automatically be displayed as public by default. This might be a concern if you want to keep your code private.
- Glitch apps go to sleep after 5 minutes of being idle, and wake up when accessed which can lead to a slight delay when accessing the site after it has been idle.
- Glitch is not designed for large-scale, high-traffic applications.
